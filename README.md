# Breast_Cancer_Detection
This repository contains the implementation of a Breast Cancer Detection System using Machine Learning techniques. The model is trained on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset to classify tumors as either malignant or benign based on various features extracted from cell nuclei.

## Dataset:
The dataset used is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset, which contains:

569 samples of tumors, each with 30 features (such as mean radius, mean texture, mean area, etc.).

A binary target variable representing whether a tumor is benign (0) or malignant (1).

## The project involves:

**Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, outliers, and label encoding.

**Model Training:** Multiple machine learning models were trained and evaluated, including:
Random Forest, 
Decision Tree, 
Logistic Regression, 
Support Vector Classifier (SVC), 
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

**Evaluation:** The models were evaluated based on accuracy and compared using visualizations.
